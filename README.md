## General Information
- When I saw a friend's struggle with building his own house and with the workers I got the idea to make a short decision-making game out of it.
- The aim of this project was to complete the game in a short amount of time, improve my C# programming skills, Unity handling and... having fun (maybe just for me :-).
- I wanted to put a special emphasis on learning how to handle "States", game states that affect the player's situation.
